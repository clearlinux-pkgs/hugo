Create vendored dependencies for offline build by updating the
projects/hugo-vendor repository. In hugo-vendor, run `make VER="<HugoVer>"` to
automate most of the process, where <HugoVer> is the upstream hugo version
(without the "v" prefix).

If a hotfix hugo-vendor release is ever needed, extend the release version with
a 4th number. For example, a hotfix release for hugo-vendor 0.64.0 would have
version "0.64.0.1", a second hotfix release would be "0.64.0.2", etc.
